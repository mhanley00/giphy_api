Parks & Rec Gif Generator

This web app brings your favorite Parks & Rec
moments to life.

This project is my first foray into APIs! It 
honestly opened up a whole new world of web
apps I can build. Parks & Rec is one of my
personal favorite tv shows (I went to school
in Indiana, go Hoosiers! ❤️) and I wanted to 
make a simple web app to make fellow fans
laugh. You know, until they get around to 
watching all 7 seasons, again.

Parks & Rec Gif Generator is built using
HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and my newly
minted JSON skills. 

Thank you to GIPHY for providing an awesome
API and equally awesome documentation.

Thank you to _Parks & Recreation_ for being
the best show ever!

PS: You many have to click to "Load Unsafe Scripts"
in order to get the gifs to render. I promise they
are, in fact, safe.
